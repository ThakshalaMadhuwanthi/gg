        <p>This page should focus on your brand's background. What's your unique story? Why <br>
            should prospective clients choose to sign up with you? This is your chance to build a <br>
            relationship with them, starting with your backstory, vision, or philosophy. You can even <br>
            share your brand's beginnings if you feel that it's relatable to your clients. Just remember to <br>
            be friendly, and welcoming. <br> <br>
            Once you're done, seal the deal with a compelling closing line that gets them to take action. <br> <br> <br> <br>
